        <p>After planning their first trip together Brian realized the Kristen was spending a lot of time constantly planning and adjusting the travel itinariries. She enjoyed doing the research, reading blogs, and peicing evertyhing together. The problem we discovered is that there typically isn't a good resource for planning a trip for someone who wants to be a bit adventurous. Kristen found herself reading and cross referencsing blog after blog and still being left with questions. As each trip progressed we found the quality of what we were experiencing was improving, then friends began to ask for help in planning their trips. We figured maybe it was time to put together our itinaries, methodolgy and experiences to help others in planning trips. Think of it like Anthony Bourdain for middle class people who want to go see cool shit. Hope you enjoy!</p>
